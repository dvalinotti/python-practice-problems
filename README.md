# Software Engineering Practice Problems

I am trying to increase my problem solving and software engineering skills by completing common practice problems/interview questions.
The reason I'm doing it in Python, rather than a new language for me to learn, is to focus more on the critical thinking 
aspect of the problems rather than syntax/language-specific information.
